Reporting Bugs
--------------

Please report any EsoRex problems to usg-help@eso.org .

When reporting bugs, please indicate the package and version. For 
example "EsoRex 3.6.8". To determine the version of the distribution 
that you are using, check the README file or type "esorex --version".


Currently Known Problems
------------------------

When a recipe is used with the --suppress-prefix option, and the 
--output-dir is set to the current working directory, then the first 
execution of a recipe will work correctly, but subsequent executions may 
fail. This is due to output products being given "read-only" permission 
(to avoid the potential inadvertent loss of products). The recipe itself
is unable to modify the permissions, and thus it fails when attempting 
to create the file. The solution (other than using a different output 
directory or prefixes) is to change the permission of these output files 
or delete them prior to any subsequent execution of that recipe.
