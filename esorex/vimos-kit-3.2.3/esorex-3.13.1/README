About EsoRex
-------------

This is version 3.13.1 of the EsoRex application. This package includes
source files to build the "esorex" executable, which allows the running
of Common Pipeline Library (CPL) plugins. Also included is the
documentation and the installation procedures.


Prerequisites
--------------

For installing the EsoRex software you require:

  * An ISO-C++ and an ISO-C99 compiler (preferably GNU gcc v4.8.5 or later)
  * CPL (version 6.5.1 or later - available from the CPL web site at ESO)
 
EsoRex also needs the libltdl development files from the GNU libtool package 
for building. However, the needed source files from GNU libtool 2.4.3a are
included in the Esorex distribution and do not need to be obtained separately.

The following optional prerequisites need to be installed only if one wants to
take advantage of the Python based recipe plugin extensions.

  * Python interpreter >= 2.6.6
  * libffi or libavcall.a (from libffcall). One of these are needed to fully
    support enumeration recipe parameters in Python based recipes. If neither
    of these libraries is available then EsoRex will completely disable the
    Python extensions. If you need to specify the location of these dependencies
    manually or need more control over these, see the configure script options
    --with-libffi* and --with-avcall* for more details (./configure --help).


Installation
------------

In order to be able to install the EsoRex tool from the source code,
you will need an installed version of the CFITSIO and CPL libraries (see
the Prerequesites, above).

To install EsoRex, unpack the tar-archive in a directory of your
choice, enter the created "esorex" directory, and run the following
commands (for more information about the options for the configure
script, please read the INSTALL file, that comes with this
distribution).

  %  ./configure --prefix=<where-esorex-will-be-installed> \
                 --with-cpl=<where-cpl-is-installed> \
                 --with-cfitsio=<where-cfitsio-is-installed>
  %  make
  %  make install


An alternative to specifying with command-line parameters in the configure 
command line where CPL and CFITSIO may be found, 
is to set the environment variables CFITSIODIR and CPLDIR accordingly.
