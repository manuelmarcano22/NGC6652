EsoRex ChangeLog
================

The following summarises the major changes and bugfixes to the EsoRex
package. The changes are grouped by major-version number, with the
most recent first. Within each grouping, the changes are listed
sequentially.


---------------
 EsoRex v3.13.x
---------------

The 3.13 series introduces extensions to EsoRex to support Python based recipes.
The following gives a summary of changes and bug fixes since the 3.12.3.

- Extended EsoRex to support Python based recipe plugins (DFS-12777).
  The support is optional, and only available when a Python interpreter is
  installed.
- Added Bash completions for esorex (requires Python to be installed).
- Fixed a bug in creation of symbolic link file names in cases where the
  requested output name does not contain a directory part, i.e. at least one
  slash.
- Overhauled and updated the build system related files, which now requires
  libtool >= 2.2.6 and Doxygen >= 1.8.


---------------
 EsoRex v3.12.x
---------------

The JSON output format for parameters has been changed. There is a new filed
called 'partype' which can be value, range or enum. The output of integers and
floats uses now native JSON representation. Note that this change is not 
backwards compatible, since the previous JSON file used quoted values for
integers and floats.

---------------
 EsoRex v3.11.x
---------------

The following summarises the major changes and bugfixes to the EsoRex
package since the release of EsoRex 3.9.5.

---------------
 EsoRex v3.7.x
---------------

The following summarises the major changes and bugfixes to the EsoRex
package since the release of EsoRex 3.6.12.


v3.7.3 -- 01-November-2009

Version of Esorex ready for CPL 5.1


v3.7.0 -- 01-February-2009

Take out dependency on libtool version 1.5.6 - should now work with any
version of libtool.



---------------
 EsoRex v3.6.x
---------------

The following summarises the major changes and bugfixes to the EsoRex
package since the release of EsoRex 3.5.0.


v3.6.12 -- 01-October-2008

Min, max values of parameter ranges are displayed correctly.
The return status is set correctly with problems in the final copy step of products.


v3.6.9 -- 17-July-2008

Environment variables can be used also inside SOFs, e.g. lines like
$MYDATA/ISAAC.2006-06-19T13:50:54.801.fits   SP_FLAT
are now supported in an SOF file.

v3.6.8 -- 14-Feb-2008

Invalid input files specified in a SOF are now ignored (only announced if message
level set to debug), esorex does not stop anymore. So, it's now entirely the 
responsibility of the recipe to check for that.
For this version of EsoRex, CPL 4.1.0 is required.

v3.6.0 -- 23-May-2006

Move from cx data types to plain C types. A few (plain) string related
utilities (e.g. cx_strdup) are still used.



---------------
 EsoRex v3.5.x
---------------

The following summarises the major changes and bugfixes to the EsoRex
package since the release of EsoRex 3.5.0.

v3.5.0 -- 25-July-2005

Just a single addition: use the new function cpl_end() to terminate all 
CPL related activity in EsoRex main code.

---------------
 EsoRex v3.4.x
---------------

The following summarises the major changes and bugfixes to the EsoRex
package since the release of EsoRex 3.4.0.

v3.4.0 -- 16-Jun-2005

This version has one small, but important change. Previously, when 
EsoRex moved a product, it would rename the suffix of the file to 
reflect the frame type. This would mean that images would be forced to 
".fits", tables to ".tfits", etc.. This feature has been disabled, so 
that now the suffix, as supplied by the recipe, is preserved.

---------------
 EsoRex v3.3.x
---------------

The following summarises the major changes and bugfixes to the EsoRex
package since the release of EsoRex 3.3.0.

v3.3.0 -- 09-Jun-2005

This version addresses outstanding bugs from the public release of
version 3.2.1. Fixed problem with some options not supporting the
environment-variable equivalent. Also modified the "--help" output to
indicate what the name of the associated environment variable is. Fixed
the problem with the "source environment variable" not being reported
correctly, when the "--msg-leve=debug" option is used. Fixed error
message reported when an output-script fails. Fixed the incorrect
behaviour of reporting of multiple instances of a given recipe. Under
"debug", additional information is given hinting at possible causes of
the problem. Also removed a memory leak associated with the provision of
an output-script. 

---------------
 EsoRex v3.2.x
---------------

The following summarises the major changes and bugfixes to the EsoRex
package since the release of EsoRex 3.2.0.

v3.2.0 -- 10-Mar-2005

Beta-release of Version 3.2. The major change is the addition of a new 
configuration parameter "mem-check". This replaces the need to run 
EsoRex at DEBUG level, in order to activate the memory status report at 
the end of EsoRex execution. Additionally, the parameter handling 
mechanism has been improved and there is now better error checking. 
Under DEBUG level, EsoRex will now report the source of a given 
parameter, either stating that it was a default or command line 
generated value, or by reporting the name of the configuration file from 
which the value was obtained.

v3.2.1 -- 27-Mar-2005

Stable-release of Version 3.2. Only one minor correction made (misleading
error message).

---------------
 EsoRex v3.1.x
---------------

The following summarises the major changes and bugfixes to the EsoRex
package since the release of EsoRex 3.1.0.

v3.1.0 -- 04-Feb-2005

Beta-release of Version 3.1. The major change is an overhaul to the 
internals of the parameter and plugin handling, in order to match the 
changes in the 02-Feb-2005 build of the CPL. Functionally, there should 
be little change, but until exhaustive testing has been performed, this 
version cannot be labelled as stable.

v3.1.1 -- 18-Feb-2005

No major changes. This release was made to coincide with internal beta-
releases of QFITS and CPL.

---------------
 EsoRex v3.0.x
---------------

The following summarises the major changes and bugfixes to the EsoRex
package since the release of EsoRex 3.0.0.

v3.0.0 -- 27-Jan-2005

Beta-release of Version 3. The major change is in the additional 
output of EsoRex in the event of multiple recipes with the same name. 
Additionally, EsoRex now makes a reasonable assumption about which of 
them to use, namely the one with the highest version number, and for 
cases where it it equal, then the first occurrence of the recipe in the 
'recipe-dir' path. In addition to these changes, the code has been 
further streamlined, and even stricter error checking has been 
implemented for the recipe-handling functions. This version also is the 
first to "officially" use the new vresions CPL and QFITS.

v3.0.1 -- 28-Jan-2005

Internal changes only. The cpl_error handling calls were modified to 
make the setting of error codes and error locations to be uniform.

v3.0.2 -- 28-Jan-2005

Fixed two bugs. The first was the incorrect reporting of the range of 
parameters that take double precision numbers. The second was a memory 
leak that occured during the creation of a configuration file.

v3.0.3 -- 31-Jan-2005

Fixed a remaining bug with the handling of double-precision parameter 
ranges.

v3.0.4 -- 02-Feb-2005

Fixed a memory leak which occurred when an invalid command-line
parameter was given to a recipe.

---------------
 EsoRex v2.0.x
---------------

The following summarises the major changes and bugfixes to the EsoRex
package since the release of EsoRex 2.0.0.

v2.0.0 -- 01-Sep-2004

Beta-release of Version 2. This change removes the --output-overwrite
option and replaces it with the --output-readonly option. The new
option satisfies the requirements of Paranal, to generate read-only
(umask = oct(444)) products for archiving purposes. Additionally, it
changes the default behaviour to allow EsoRex to overwrite existing
products by default (the typical case for users) when re-running a
recipe.

v2.0.1 -- 23-Sep-2004

Minor fix to the formatting of double precision numbers that appear in
the "help" text or "configuration" files. In the case of integer values
that are stored as a double, the output still appends a ".0", so that
the user is not confused by the value that is written (that is, in
some way misleading them that the value is an integer, when it is not).

v2.0.2 -- 05-Oct-2004

This patch removes several memory leaks. EsoRex should now run though 
valgrind (http://valgrind.kde.org/) without any errors from the EsoRex 
code itself.

v2.0.3 -- 01-Dec-2004

This patch fixes some problems with error messages not being clear. 
Message reporting has been standardised somewhat too. It also has
improved accompanying text-file documentation. This version requires
the "beta-release" of CPL version 2.0 and qfits version 5.0.

v2.0.4 -- 10-Jan-2005

When "--msg-level" is set to "debug", EsoRex will report (via xmemory)
any still-allocated pointers at the conclusion of operation. This may
prove helpful in indicating problems with recipes during development.
Also in this version, a small memory leak was fixed, and a missing
header file was included to avoid compiler warnings on some systems.

v2.0.5 -- 18-Jan-2005

This version replaces two of the deprecated functions from the 
conversion to CPL 2.0. The change is internal only.


---------------
 EsoRex v1.0.x
---------------

The following summarises the major changes and bugfixes to the EsoRex 
package since the release of EsoRex 1.0.0.

v1.0.0 -- 25-Jun-2004

Public release version of EsoRex.

v1.0.1 -- 29-Jun-2004

Minor fix to correct the sequence order output of the man-page content
generated for a recipe.

v1.0.2 -- 09-Jul-2004

Bug fix to the handling of ranged input parameters, so that the minima
and maxima themselves are not excluded. Also, some minor improvement to
man-page output, to better describe available recipe options.

v1.0.3 -- 20-Jul-2004

Changed EsoRex to use the CPL messsaging system for all error, warning
and status messages. Normal output is still used for generated
documentary output (for example, man-pages).

v1.0.4 -- 21-Jul-2004

Fixed a bug in the handling of floating-point numbers. Now the minimum
precision is used in order to maintain numerical integrity. Should the
precision exceed the maximum that can be handled by EsoRex, then a
warning will be printed.

v1.0.5 -- 02-Aug-2004

Added handling of environment variables. This requires the WORDEXP 
package, but the program will continue to function, even in its absence.

v1.0.6 -- 23-Aug-2004

Improved the handling of floating-point numbers. EsoRex now handles a
greater range of precision without loss of accuracy, and warns the user
if a conversion occurs where accuracy is lost. Also removed the hard-
coded CPL messaging width (80); EsoRex now adopts the terminal width for
output, and only defaults to 80 characters in the event that it can not
be determined. Also, the error messages for failure of the options
'--recipe-dir', '--log-dir' and '--log-file' have now been improved.

v1.0.7 -- 25-Aug-204

Corrected a problem with the CPL messaging domain not being set back to 
EsoRex at the end of recipe initialisation, execution and destruction. 
Additionally, a minor problem with newline handling was fixed for the 
case when a single product is created.
