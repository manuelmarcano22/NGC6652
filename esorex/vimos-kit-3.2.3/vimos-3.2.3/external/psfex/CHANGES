This is V1.8.1 (October 13 1999). New features include:
- Optimized handling of oversampled data.
- Enhanced PSF selection.

/*- Previous notes for V1.6.0 (Mar 14 1999) */
- Memory leaks removed from the LDACTools.
- Bug fix in Constant PSF-mode.
- RESIDUALS check-image now display absolute residuals
- PSF_CHITHRESH config parameter replaced by PSF_NSUPER,
  which sets the default number of pixels to super-resolve
  (defaulted to 64).

/*- Previous notes for V1.5.1 (Mar 8 1999) */
- Bug fix in PSF Autoselection.
- SNAPSHOTS check-image bug fixed.

/*- Previous notes for V1.5.0 (Mar 7 1999) */
- Automatic FWHM finder.
- Object elongation taken into account.
- Automatic sampling step.
- Re-centering of PSF-candidates.
- Chi2-filtering of PSF-candidates with odd shapes.
- Optimization of solving routine.

/*- Previous notes for V1.4 (Feb 20 1999) */
- Solving optimized for sparse matrices.
- Polynomial ``groups'' for parameters that are linked together.
- Automatic downsizing of degrees of freedom when not enough PSF
  candidates are available.
- Works with SExtractor 2.0.20 and later.

/*- Previous notes for V1.3 (Dec 27 1998) */
- PSF_MINSN config parameter setting the minimum S/N for PSF candidates.
- PSF super-resolution for aliased pixels.
