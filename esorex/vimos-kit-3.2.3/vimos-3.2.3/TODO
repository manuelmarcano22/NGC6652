* Add recipes for 4 quadrant astrometry and MOS spectro-photometric
  calibration.

* Change jitter recipes such that they can be used for stare observations
  too and get rid of the specific recipes for stare mode.

* Add flat field creation to the imaging jitter recipe to get rid of
  fringes in the I and z band.
